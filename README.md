 Developed a health prediction system using AIML (Artificial Intelligence
Machine learning).
 Applied a Random Forest classifier, showcasing the application of machine
learning in healthcare.                                                                                                                                                          Predicts health outcomes or conditions based on input features, contributing to
proactive healthcare.
 Implemented IoT (Internet of Things) technology to collect real-time data using
a heartbeat sensor.
 Enhanced the system's capabilities by integrating real-time physiological data for
more accurate predictions.
Technologies and Tools Used:
